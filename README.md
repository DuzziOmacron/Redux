# About
This is a Kik botnet that uses the [Tomer8007 Kik Bot API](https://github.com/tomer8007/kik-bot-api-unofficial) to spam users and groups.
(Version 5.1)

I've hosted a copy on Replit for those of you who want to run it from your web browser, which you can find [here](https://replit.com/@StethoSaysHello/KikBotnet?v=1).

# Installation

Make sure you are using Python 3.6+, not python 2.7!

Use `git clone https://github.com/StethoSaysHello/KikBotnet`

Then just run [botnet.py](https://github.com/StethoSaysHello/KikBotnet/blob/main/botnet.py), it will install all of the needed dependancies for you. 

_Alternatively, you can just copy and paste the contents of [botnet.py](https://github.com/StethoSaysHello/KikBotnet/blob/main/botnet.py)._

# Usage

Once you run the script, the prompts should be self explanatory, but if you need an elaboration on each step [click here](https://pastebin.com/6kdHjVKk).

You cannot trigger the botnet from the terminal, you need to trigger the bots themselves via messages on Kik. To trigger an entire botnet, either add the whole botnet to a group and use the command, or send a mass message to each bot's PMs via modded Kik. Keep in mind that you need to make your own bot accounts, it will not make them for you!
