# About
This is a Kik botnet that uses the [Tomer8007 Kik Bot API](https://github.com/tomer8007/kik-bot-api-unofficial) to spam users and groups.
(Version 5.0)

Huge thank you to Okia and Node for ideas on new features to add and potential bug/issue solutions!

# Installation

Make sure you are using Python 3.6+, not python 2.7!

Use `git clone https://github.com/StethoSaysHello/KikBotnet`

Then just run [main.py](https://github.com/StethoSaysHello/KikBotnet/blob/main/main.py), it will install all of the needed dependancies and modules for you. 

_Alternatively, you can just copy and paste the contents of main.py._

# Usage

Once you run [main.py](https://github.com/StethoSaysHello/KikBotnet/blob/main/main.py), the prompts should be self explanatory, but if you need an elaboration on each step [click here](https://pastebin.com/6kdHjVKk).

You cannot trigger the botnet from the terminal, you need to trigger the bots themselves via messages on Kik. To trigger an entire botnet, either add the whole botnet to a group and use the command, or send a mass message to each bot's PMs via modded Kik.

- **"Spam [JID or Username] w/ [Message]"** -  Used to spam a user's PMs.

- **"Poke [JID or username] w/ [Message]"** -  Used for forwarding a single message to a user.

- **"Friend"** - Used to add the bot as a friend so that you can add it to groups.

- **"SendFriend [JID or Username]"** - Used to send a friend attribution request to a user.

- **"GroupSpam [Message]"** - Used to spam the group that this command is used in.

- **"Leave [GJID]"** - Used for making your bot(s) leave groups.

# Disclaimers
