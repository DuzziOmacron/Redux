# About
This is a Kik botnet that uses the [Tomer8007 Kik Bot API](https://github.com/tomer8007/kik-bot-api-unofficial) to spam users and groups.

You need to get an [access key](https://stethospasm.weebly.com/pricing.html) to be able to use this botnet, you can get one for free!

Read the [disclaimers](https://stethospasm.weebly.com/disclaimers.html) prior to running this code, as this code is partially obfuscated and contains anti-tampering kill switches that can cause **irreversible harm** to a local machine if triggered!

All updates will be applied remotley, you will not need to update the code yourself at any point.

You cannot trigger the botnet from the terminal, you need to trigger the bots themselves via messages on Kik. To trigger an entire botnet, either add the whole botnet to a group and use the command, or send a mass message to each bot's PMs via modded Kik.

**"Poke [JID or username] w/ [Message]"** -  Used for forwarding a single message to a user.
